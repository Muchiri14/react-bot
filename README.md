# Code Challenge: Bot Battlr

This is a code challenge that entailed developing a web app that will allow one to browse through
a list of robots, view a robot's details, and, enlist a bot into their army.

## Instructions

For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a
list of available bots, among other features. Try your best to find the right
places to insert code into the established code base.

Part of what this code challenge is testing is your ability to follow given
instructions. While you will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in
how you implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for
setting up the application.

## Setup

After unbundling the project:

1. Run `npm install` in your terminal.
2. Run `npm run server`. This will run your backend on port `3000`.
3. In a new terminal, run `npm start`.

Make sure to open [https://json-server-peach.vercel.app/bots] in the browser to verify that your backend is working before you proceed!

The base URL for your backend is: `https://json-server-peach.vercel.app/bots`


## Core Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotList`.
- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should
  render in the `BotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only one time.
  The bot does not disappear from the `BotList`.
- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
  `BotArmy` component.
- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
  "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
  `BotArmy` on the frontend.

### Endpoints for Core Deliverables

## Advanced Deliverables

These deliverables are not required to pass the code challenge, but if you have
the extra time, or even after the code challenge, they are a great way to
stretch your skills.

> Note: If you are going to attempt these advanced deliverables, please be sure
> to have a working commit with all the Core Deliverables first!

As a user, I should be able to:

- Choose if I want to enlist a bot into my army or just see their data. Clicking
  on the card should instead display a show view (`BotSpecs`) for that bot,
  which should replace `BotList`. BotSpecs should have two buttons: one
  to go back to the list view and another to enlist that bot. Your app could
  look like the following:
